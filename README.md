# About code

code: Java <br>
Tools:Eclipse

<p>In this stage, I was assigned the task of developing a currency converter using Java programming language. The goal was to create a software that allows users to convert currencies from their country's currency to several other currencies, including US Dollars $, Euros ðŸ’¶, British Pounds ðŸ’· Japanese Yen ðŸ’´, and South Korean Won ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·. Additionally, I extended the converter to include temperature ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥µ and distance conversion functionalities.

The application was built using Eclipse IDE, and the user interface was designed to provide a seamless for the users. Through the software, users can easily input the amount in their country's currency and select the desired conversion option from a dropdown menu. The converter then displays the converted amount in the chosen currency.

Furthermore, the application also enables users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, as well as distances between kilometers and meters. The interface remains intuitive, allowing users to perform multiple conversions without any hassle.</p>
